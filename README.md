# Civil3D-Highway-Geometric-Design 🛣️

## 📌 Description
A highway geometric design project developed in **Autodesk Civil 3D**, featuring detailed horizontal and vertical alignments, corridor modeling, and surface analysis for construction planning and cost estimation.

---

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Civil 3D for highway design and corridor modeling**.  
The project covers a **1.8 km highway alignment** with an elevation range of **91–102 m**, designed for a **speed of 100 km/h**, following **AASHTO/IRC geometric design standards**.  

It highlights proficiency in:
- Roadway alignment design  
- Corridor and surface modeling  
- Profile optimization   
- Construction planning and feasibility assessment
